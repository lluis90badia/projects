## Objectives

- Understand, clean and process the selected database using Microsoft Excel.
- Import the processed file into Power BI to amend the sheets in Power Query, and to visualise the data through charts.
- Analyse whether the survey data realistically reflects the current European labour market context.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Survey Completion and Data Collection:
- Introduced our job position details.
- Downloaded the dataset in an Excel file for further analysis.
  
### 2. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in [Excel](https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/salary_survey.xlsx):
- Header simplification:<br>Clarified headers for better readability and identification.
- Initial Data Overview:<br>Created a pivot table and charts for an initial context overview.
- Noise Reduction and Standardisation:<br>Developed formulas (IF, OR, AND, ISNUMBER, SEARCH functions) to group dimensions based on variables such as Industry, Race, Gender, and Position Level (refer to the attached [TXT file](https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/salary_survey_formulas.txt) for detailed formulas).
- Salary Data Standardisation:<br>Converted the “Annual Salary” column from general to Currency (€) format, applying specific conversion rates for other currencies. In addition, the “Other” currency category excluded rows without specified salaries.
- Salary Interval Analysis:<br>Utilised FREQUENCY and PERCENTILE functions to analyse salary data with the knowledge gained by searching for information about average salary data and position levels across Europe.
- Bonus Variable Standardisation:<br>Added a binary column for the “bonus” variable, indicating “YES” if the value is greater than 0, and “NO” if the cell is blank or 0.
- Data Segregation:<br>Segregated columns into sheets based on Demography, Salary, Location, and Job data to facilitate the creation of a data model in Power BI.

### 3. Data Preparation & Visualisation in [Power BI](https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/salary_survey.pbix):

- Data Import and Preparation:<br>Refined the sheets in Power Query by removing unnecessary columns and adjusting data types to enable chart creation. After that, Imported the Excel file containing the segregated sheets to build a data model based on respondent IDs.

- Measure Creation:<br>
  - Developed measures to calculate:<br>
    - Percentages of total respondents for dimensions such as Gender and Race (formulas available in the [TXT file](https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/salary_survey_formulas.txt) attached).<br>
    - Average salary.<br>
    - A card on the “Demography” tab to display selected industries or “All” if all are selected.<br>
  - Interactive Features:<br>
    - Added a moving filter bar on the “Demography” tab, toggled by a filter icon (using bookmarks) and a hide icon (left-pointing arrow in a circle).<br>
    <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/images/demography2.PNG"  height="450"></p>
    
    - Created a “Clear Filters” action on all tabs except “Summary” to reset filters on the page.<br>
  - Chart Creation:
    - Developed various charts to analyse respondent data. The conclusions are presented in the next section.

## Conclusions

### Summary:<br>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/images/summary.PNG"  height="450"></p>

The survey indicates a predominant profile: a white, college-educated woman in her late twenties to early thirties, based in the USA, working in IT or education at a mid-level position, with over a decade of experience, and earning an annual salary of €40-60K.

### Demography:<br>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/images/demography1.PNG"  height="450"></p>

   - Gender: 76% of respondents are women, yet they have the lowest average earnings, except in India and remote positions.
   - Race: “White” respondents comprise 83% but do not have the highest average salaries due to their majority representation.
   - Education & Age: Higher education levels and older age groups report higher salaries, following logical trends.

### Industry & Position Level:<br>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/images/position.PNG"  height="450"></p>

  - There is generally no correlation between reported position levels and actual salaries, categorised by European salary intervals.
  - Filters reveal most junior respondents, particularly from the USA (85%), should be promoted to mid-level positions due to higher salaries compared to European counterparts.
  - In the “Industry” dimension, most hospitality workers should be at the intermediate level, while IT workers should hold better positions based on European salary context.
  - More respondents reported not receiving bonuses (54%). Bonus-receiving industries include consulting, engineering, finance, insurance, technology, and marketing, known for their results-oriented performance, market competitiveness, and business models based on commissions and incentives.

### Position Level – Reported vs. Actual:<br>
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/lluis90badia/projects/blob/main/data_analyst_projects/salary_survey_excel_powerbi/images/responded_vs_actual.PNG"  height="450"></p>

Significant discrepancies exist between reported position levels and those inferred from salaries. While 61% of reported positions are mid-level and 28% senior management, the actual distribution (based on European context) would be more balanced with 32% at the intermediate level. Concretely, Law and Veterinary sectors exhibit the most notable discrepancies.
